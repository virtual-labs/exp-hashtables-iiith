### Introduction

Like separate chaining, open addressing is a method for handling collisions. In Open Addressing, all elements are stored in the hash table itself. So at any point, size of the table must be greater than or equal to the total number of keys.
### Types of Open Addressing Method

Open addressing is done in the following ways:

a. Linear Probing <br> 

b. Quadratic Probing <br> 

c. Double Hashing <br>
