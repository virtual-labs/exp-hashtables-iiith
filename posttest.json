                "a": "If all keys hash to the same location, finding the i-th inserted key will require I lookups. Since the i-th key is random, the probability of looking it up is 1/n.",
                "b": "If all keys hash to different locations, the inserted key can be found in constant time.",
                "c": "If all keys hash to an even-numbered index, we can't say about the running time as they can all be mapped to the same index or different even-numbered indexes.",
                "d": "If all keys hash to different locations, the inserted key can be found in constant time."
